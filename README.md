# Dijkstra's Algorithm Visualization

This Python project provides a visualization of Dijkstra's algorithm using the Pygame library. Dijkstra's algorithm is a widely used algorithm in graph theory for finding the shortest path between nodes in a weighted graph. This visualization allows you to interactively create a grid, set obstacles, specify the start and target nodes, and observe how Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest path.
